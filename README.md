## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Extraction and Transformation
- **Input Format**: YAML files organized by months and dates.
- **Goal**: Convert all data into CSV format.
- **Process**:
  1. Loop through each month's directory.
  2. For each date-wise YAML file, extract relevant fields (e.g., symbol, close price, volume).
  3. Organize data by symbols.
  4. Save each symbol’s data into a separate CSV file.
- **Output**: 50+ CSV files, one per stock symbol.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Loading
- **Tools Used**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Actions**:
  - Load all CSVs into a combined DataFrame.
  - Parse date columns and ensure correct data types.
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Calculate daily returns.
